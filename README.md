# Buil and train a model using TensorFlow core APIs

In this project we will build and train a Multiple Linear Regression model using TensorFlow Core low_level APIs. The data is Auto MPG whichi is available at the ML repository of UCI. The dataset's size is 398. In this model we will predict fuel efficiency. 

### Steps to follow in this project:
- Load the dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg , or we can download the data and access to the folder and process the data. 
- Build a multiple Linear Model.
- Evaluate the model.
